Your code looks good and is mostly correct for loading and preprocessing a heart disease dataset using pandas and LabelEncoder. Below is a quick review, with suggestions to improve readability, robustness, and maintainability:

‚úÖ What your code does well:
Reads an Excel file correctly.

Applies LabelEncoder to multiple categorical columns.

Separates features (x) and target (y) for model training.

üîß Suggestions for Improvement:
Use consistent variable naming:
Use X and `y

ChatGPT said:
Your full pipeline is solid for a beginner-level machine learning project using Naive Bayes for heart disease prediction. Here's a concise review with best practices, improvements, and potential enhancements:

‚úÖ What‚Äôs Working Well:
Correct train-test split (80/20).

Naive Bayes model training and prediction.

Accuracy metric used for evaluation.

Includes a manual prediction example.

üîß Suggested Improvements:
1. Display predictions in a cleaner way
Use y_test.values to show actual labels properly:

print("Predicted values:", y_predict)
print("Actual values   :", y_test.values)
2. Confusion Matrix & Classification Report (Optional but helpful)
To evaluate model performance better:

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report

cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_predict)
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", cm)

print("\nClassification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_predict))
3. Check Input Dimensions for Manual Prediction
Make sure the input is reshaped as a 2D array and matches feature count:

import numpy as np

sample_input = np.array([[36,1,0,109,281,1,2,99,0,2.5,2,1,0,0]])
prediction = model.predict(sample_input)

if prediction[0] == 1:
    print("Person has heart disease")
else:
    print("Person does not have heart disease")
4. (Optional) Add Feature Names for Manual Prediction
To avoid errors, match the manual input exactly to the preprocessed features in x.columns. You can also build a function:

def predict_heart_disease(input_data):
    input_array = np.array([input_data])
    result = model.predict(input_array)
    return "Person has heart disease" if result[0] == 1 else "Person does not have heart disease"

print(predict_heart_disease([36,1,0,109,281,1,2,99,0,2.5,2,1,0,0]))
‚úÖ Final Tip:
For better modeling performance, consider:

Trying RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression, or XGBoost.

Performing cross-validation for reliable metrics.

Doing feature scaling (e.g., StandardScaler) for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitude (not necessary for Naive Bayes though).
